# Algorithm_summary
## Introduction
This repository houses code templates for basic algorithms, such as binary tree traversal, and provides examples. 
Most/all algorithms will be written in `Python`. Since some data structures are missing in the `Python language`, I will define some data structures myself, such as the nodes of a tree.
